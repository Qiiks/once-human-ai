PSI Intensity:

PSI intensity is a direct multiplier for elemental damage output. Higher PSI intensity translates to significantly increased elemental damage, making it a cornerstone stat for elemental builds.1 Specific gear pieces, particularly certain mods and key items, are designed to influence PSI intensity. Identifying and integrating these components becomes a critical consideration for maximizing elemental build effectiveness.1 â—‹ Star Rating, Tier, and Calibration:
